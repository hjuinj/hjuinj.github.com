I hope will be the first of a continuous, regular series of posts providing brief summaries concerning different areas of the scientific literature. By attempting to rephrase the encountered material I can probably better understand the underlying theory. It also allows me to keep a record of what I have done.


- [The Hallmarks of Aging](http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(13)00645-4).


- Quantum Mechanics for Scientist and Engineers.

- [Could a neuroscientist understand a microprocessor?](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/26/055624)
The preprint paper begs the question that can *fundamental insights* be gained through more and better data?
reverse-engineered a simple processor unit MOS6502 with manageable number of transistors.
using more and more detailed analysis
a simulational program was written to mimic the performance of the processor unit.
However, we can not currently evaluate if better analysis techniques, even with far more data, can figure out meaningful models of the brain.

what is classified as an understanding of the system
suggest using the processor as a way to test what methodology might be about to lead to correct conclusions for the brain, despite gross differences between the two systems.

- Introduction to Apache Spark.

This is a 3 week course offered on [edX](edx.org), a relatively gentle lead into the area of data science using Apache Spark, which is a distributed framework to treat big data via parallelism. I participated in a similar offering about a year ago. Due to the dynamic and vibrant nature of the field, additional features have been amended and added since then. This time ,they have also chosen to have the assignment directly done on [Databricks](databricks.com), who is the main contributor to Apache Spark, rather than having to configure a virtual machine to run this last time which meant it cumbersome to adapt the hardware architecture to perform customary jobs. Plus they are adding more content into the series. This is the first of a series of 3 (or potentially 5) course in data science using this architecture. So this is a somewhat revision.

To do this course requires some programming foundation in python. It is certainly very interesting to follow, though I suspect to fully appreciate the usefulness of the content requires at least a vague understanding of the time bottleneck of manipulating massive datasets.
