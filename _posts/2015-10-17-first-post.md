The last time I wrote a blog post was too long ago. I was using this service called Qzone. 
<!--- and I was more focused on the writing than the formatting. -->

I was a kid, mumbling about nothing, in Chinese.

To give you a glimpse [Qzone](http://user.qzone.qq.com/348601585):

I never go back and read what I write: afraid I will be overwhelmed by the level stupidity. But to be fair, I think I write well, at least in Chinese.

## Why this?

So why do I come back to blogging? Have I got too much time to kill?

NOOOOO! On the contrary, my time is **_VERY_** valuable. I look to accomplish a lot in this year and time is not on my side. 

I came back because I believe I have something valuble to say. Firstly, I would like to share my experience as a Chemistry undergrad, and my perspectives of scientific research. 
I also would like to keep track of this wonderfull placement year I am having at UCB Pharma, keeping notes about the drug-discovery pipeline I have been exposed to. Of course, UCB, nothing confidential will be publisised, I promise.
I would like to especially write about cheminformatics, which sadly isn't at all emphasised in my undergraduate studies.

I aim to explain what were once esoteric concepts to me or present interesting literatures I have encountered at the level of a science undergrad. Also I would like to point to some resources I found to be useful.

So what's in this for **me**? Well, manifold really. For one, I think writting blogs can definitly improve my writing skill. Those papers ain't gonna write themselves.

##Anything else?
YES!!!!!! As you can see this blog is hosted on github, using Jekyll, which is a new tool I am learning to use, along with other funky stuffs I am or planning to work on, (text scrappers, plugins, open sourced projects, etc).

I have taken far far far too many online courses. It is time to put those knowledege to test. I enjoy science, I enjoy technology. Atoms + Bits -> the way forward (R much?).

## So
So, I hope I will keep up, well, who knows...

I would like to leave you with this, which I signatured at the end of every blog post I had on Qzone, when I was that little kid:
