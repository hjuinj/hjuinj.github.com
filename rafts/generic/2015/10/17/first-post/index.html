      <p>The last time I wrote a blog post was too long ago. I was using this service called Qzone. 
<!--- and I was more focused on the writing than the formatting. --></p>

<p>I was a kid, mumbling about nothing, in Chinese.</p>

<p>To give you a glimpse <a href="http://user.qzone.qq.com/348601585">Qzone</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/qzone.png" alt="qzone" /></p>

<p>I never go back and read what I write: afraid I will be overwhelmed by the level stupidity. But to be fair, I think I write well, at least in Chinese.</p>

<h2 id="why-this">Why this?</h2>

<p>So why do I come back to blogging? Have I got too much time to kill?</p>

<p>NOOOOO! On the contrary, my time is <strong><em>VERY</em></strong> valuable. I look to accomplish a lot in this year and time is not on my side.</p>

<p>I came back because I believe I have something valuble to say. Firstly, I would like to share my experience as a Chemistry undergrad, and my perspectives of scientific research. 
I also would like to keep track of this wonderfull placement year I am having at UCB Pharma, keeping notes about the drug-discovery pipeline I have been exposed to. Of course, UCB, nothing confidential will be publisised, I promise.
I would like to especially write about cheminformatics, which sadly isn’t at all emphasised in my undergraduate studies.</p>

<p>I aim to explain what were once esoteric concepts to me or present interesting literatures I have encountered at the level of a science undergrad. Also I would like to point to some resources I found to be useful.</p>

<p>So what’s in this for <strong>me</strong>? Well, manifold really. For one, I think writting blogs can definitly improve my writing skill. Those papers ain’t gonna write themselves.</p>

<h2 id="anything-else">Anything else?</h2>
<p>YES!!!!!! As you can see this blog is hosted on github, using Jekyll, which is a new tool I am learning to use, along with other funky stuffs I am or planning to work on, (text scrappers, plugins, open sourced projects, etc).</p>

<p>I have taken far far far too many online courses. It is time to put those knowledege to test. I enjoy science, I enjoy technology. Atoms + Bits -&gt; the way forward (R much?).</p>

<h2 id="so">So</h2>
<p>So, I hope I will keep up, well, who knows…</p>

<p>I would like to leave you with this, which I signatured at the end of every blog post I had on Qzone, when I was that little kid:</p>
