This is a list of specialised terms I have come-across in my work and study that I was unfamiliar with af first. It is a rather diverse list and will sure to grow with time.


Here is the glossary:

1. Glossary
{:toc}
#alpha-Amanitin
Eight amino acid long cyclic peptide.Deadly toxin.
This toxin interacts with RNA Pol II and to a lesser extent RNA Pol III such that the polymerases cannot translocate along the DNA very well, leading to cell death.

# Blotting
 - western blot
A blot involving the transfer of proteins from a gel to a membrane followed by probing with a specific antibody

 - southern blot
A blot involving the transfer of DNA from a gel to a membrane followed by probing with a labeled oligonucleotide

 - northern blot
A blot involving the transfer of RNA from a gel to a membrane followed by probing with a labeled oligonucleotide


 
# ChIP-Seq:
- Crosslink protein to DNA using formaldehyde 
- Shear DNA
- Immunoprecipitate target protein and associated DNA
- Reverse crosslink; purify DNA
- Prepare DNA for sequencing
- Sequence DNA libraries and map reads back to the genome

  


# Chromatin:
DNA and all its associated protein

# Cyclin T1/CDk9.
Kinase.
It's part of transcription factor TFIIH. It phosphorylates the C terminal domain of RNA polymerase II specifically at the serine 5 of repeat.
Upon phosphorylation the mediator become unbound to the RNAP II. Subsequently promoter release is stimulated.


# FRET

# Hi-C Sequenencing Assay
Identifies distal interactions mediated by (presumably promotor protein) on chromosomal DNA strands:

1. 	Crosslink protein to DNA and protein to protein using formaldehyde. 
2. 	Isolate chromosomal DNA from the cell and cut the DNA with restriction enzymes.
3. 	Fill in ends with biotin-NTP.  
4. 	Ligate nearby ends together.
5. 	Reverse crosslink and purify DNA from protein.
6. 	Shear the DNA into lengths appropriate for sequencing.
7. 	Pull down DNA with biotin using streptavidin-coated beads.  
8. 	Deep sequence the DNA fragments.
9. 	Search for junctions between distant sequences.

# Nucleosome


darC, a gene with stress-induced expression in the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis infects more than 30% of the human population and causes more than a million deaths a year.  

(Note that, for many bacterial systems like this one, biologists use the notation abcD to refer to a gene name, and AbcD to refer to the protein that gene encodes.)
