<p>#Source Coding
As it is desirable to transmit as few bits as possible, it is good to try to compress the amount of information requried to be sent.</p>

<p>After which additional sequence of bits are added to reduce the bit error (channel encoding) caused by the channel</p>

<p>##Lossless coding
Ensures all of the original information is kept through the encoding.
###Informational Entropy 
Average (weighted sum) informationi content within a bit, taking into account the likelihood of a bit turning out to be 1 or 0. 
The maximum level of information is obtained when it is equally likely to retrive a 1 or 0 from the unknown bit.</p>

<p>Summarising to the case where more than two possiblities(rather than only 1 or 0) can arise,
the general expression goes as: 
<script type="math/tex">H = -\sum_{i=1}^k p_i log(p_i)</script>
where i denotes one out of k possible outcomes of a random variable. The k possible outcomes is basically the fundamental unit of the message we try to convey, i.e. it can the alphabet (plus a few punctuations) of the English language.</p>

<p>###Huffman compression 
When the possible outcomes are not uniformly distributed, H would reduce. This is a measure of the lower bound of the <strong>average</strong> code length needed. 
Lower the H, the less encoding. Huffman compression exploit this by recursively combining the least frequent two outcomes together to creat a new parent node until all outcomes have combined into a (unbalanced) binary tree. 
(CS101 from Harvard has a fairly good Huffman tree decoding programming exercise in C, try write the Huffman encoding as well if you are interested)
To ensure unique representation of these outcomes using only 1 and 0, 1 is usually chosen as the stopping bit, so the most likely/frequently visited node is represented by 1, and the next 01, the next 001 … the second last 0….01 and the final node 0….00.</p>

<p>The performance of this encoding is not necessary the most optimal, though .</p>

<p>Given the probability of each outcome as an array, here is a quick hack of the steps it takes to merge it into a tree in python.</p>

<h1 id="band-sharing">Band Sharing</h1>
<p>Wireless communcation for multiple user is achieved by frequency division multiplexing(FDM) and letting each user have a separate band of frequency</p>

<p>The signal is modulated up from the low frequency the original message (e.g. voice) to
the high freq that is allowed to transmit. Modulation is achieved using:
cos(low)cos(high) = 0.5(cos(low+high) + cos(high-low))</p>
