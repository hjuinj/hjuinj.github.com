<p>##Structure of <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=4YG2">RNA Pol</a>
- 5 Subunits:
      - 2α, 1β and 1β’ and a ω
      - active site at the two β interface</p>

<p>RNAP(ol) complexes with a σ subunit forming a holoenzyme, which promotes sequence specific transcription, meaning σ recongnize RNA promotor sequence. The core RNAP can transcribe starting from any nicks or ends of ds-DNA.  σ adopts an extended conformation, with domains 2, 3, and 4 interacting with different parts of the RNA polymerase core.</p>

<p>##RNAP promoter(proteins that attach to the transcription site upstream regions)
Various upstream sites to the transcription starting site (TSS) which is akin to the origin of replication in cell division process</p>

<p>Promoter sequence mapping can be done by nucleotide mutation upstream to the TSS, and assay the impact on transcription activity with aforementioned techniques in the previouse lecture.</p>

<p>Alternativly, promoter fusion assay replaces the mRNA coded protein sequence to one that can be easily detected (e.g. fluorecent protein) and so the protein production is directly correlated to any mutation change to the promoter region</p>

<ul>
  <li>The V-MD protein is a transcriptional regulator that suppresses transcription of its target genes by binding and blocking access to promoters.</li>
  <li>operons are groups of bacterial genes that are translated from a single mRNA transcript</li>
</ul>
